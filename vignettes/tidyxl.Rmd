# tidyxl

[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) imports non-tabular data from Excel
files into R.  It exposes cell content, position, formatting and comments in a
tidy structure for further manipulation, especially by the
[unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) package.  It supports the
xml-based file formats '.xlsx' and '.xlsm' via the embedded
[RapidXML](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net) C++ library.  It does not support
the binary file formats '.xlsb' or '.xls'.

## Installation

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("nacnudus/tidyxl")
```

## Examples

The package includes a spreadsheet, 'titanic.xlsx', which contains the following
pivot table:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
ftable(Titanic, row.vars = 1:2)
```

The multi-row column headers make this difficult to import.  A popular package
for importing spreadsheets coerces the pivot table into a dataframe. It treats
the second header row as though it were observations.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
titanic <- system.file("extdata/titanic.xlsx", package = "tidyxl")
readxl::read_excel(titanic)
```

[Tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) doesn't coerce the pivot table into
a data frame.  Instead, it represents each cell in its own row, where it
describes the cell's address, value and other properties.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyxl)
x <- tidy_xlsx(titanic)$data$Sheet1
# Specific sheets can be requested using `tidy_xlsx(file, sheet)`
str(x)
```

In this structure, the cells can be found by filtering.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x[x$data_type == "character", c("address", "character")]
x[x$row == 4, c("address", "character", "numeric")]
```

### Formatting

The original spreadsheet has formatting applied to the cells.  This can also be
retrieved using [tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl).

![](./titanic-screenshot.png)

Formatting is available by using the columns `local_format_id` and
`style_format_id` as indexes into a separate list-of-lists structure.  'Local'
formatting is the most common kind, applied to individual cells.  'Style'
formatting is usually applied to blocks of cells, and defines several formats at
once.  Here is a screenshot of the styles buttons in Excel.

![](./styles-screenshot.png)

Formatting can be looked up as follows.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
# Bold
formats <- tidy_xlsx(titanic)$formats
formats$local$font$bold
x[x$local_format_id %in% which(formats$local$font$bold),
  c("address", "character")]

# Yellow fill
formats$local$fill$patternFill$fgColor$rgb
x[x$local_format_id %in%
  which(formats$local$fill$patternFill$fgColor$rgb == "FFFFFF00"),
  c("address", "numeric")]

# Styles by name
formats$style$font$name["Normal"]
head(x[x$style_format == "Normal", c("address", "character")])
```

To see all the available kinds of formats, use `str(formats)`.

### Comments

Comments are available alongside cell values.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
x[!is.na(x$comment), c("address", "comment")]
```

### Formulas

Formulas are available, but with a few quirks.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
options(width = 120)
y <- tidy_xlsx(system.file("/extdata/examples.xlsx", package = "tidyxl"),
               "Sheet1")$data[[1]]
y[!is.na(y$formula),
  c("address", "formula", "formula_type", "formula_ref", "formula_group",
    "error", "logical", "numeric", "date", "character")]
```

The top five cells show that the results of formulas are available as usual in
the columns `error`, `logical`, `numeric`, `date`, and `character`.

Cells `A20` and `A21` share a formula definition.  The formula is given
against cell `A20`, and assigned to `formula_group` `0`, which spans the cells
given by the `formula_ref`, A20:A21.  A spreadsheet application would infer that
cell `A21` had the formula `A20+1`.  Cells `B20` and `B21` are similar.  The
roadmap for [tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) includes
de-normalising shared formulas.  If you can suggest how to tokenize Excel
formulas, then please contact me.

Cell `A22` contains an array formula, which, in a spreadsheet application, would
appear with curly braces `{SUM(A19:A21*B19:B21)}`.  Cells `A23` and `A24`
contain a single multi-cell array formula (single formula, multi-cell result),
indicated by the `formula_ref`, but unlike cells `A20:A21` and `B20:B21`, the
`formula` for A24 is NA rather than blank (`""`), and it doesn't have a
`formula_group`.

Cell `A25` contains a formula that refers to another file.  The `[1]` is an
index into a table of files.  The roadmap
[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) for tidyxl includes de-referencing
such numbers.

[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) imports the same table into a
format suitable for non-tabular processing (see e.g. the
[unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) package in 'Similar projects'
below).

## Philosophy

Information in in many spreadsheets cannot be easily imported into R.  Why?

Most R packages that import spreadsheets have difficulty unless the layout of
the spreadsheet conforms to a strict definition of a 'table', e.g.:

* observations in rows
* variables in columns
* a single header row
* all information represented by characters, whether textual, logical, or
  numeric

These rules are designed to eliminate ambiguity in the interpretation of the
information.  But most spreadsheeting software relaxes these rules in a trade of
ambiguity for expression via other media:

* proximity (other than headers, i.e. other than being the first value at the
  top of a column)
* formatting (colours and borders)

Humans can usually resolve the ambiguities with contextual knowledge, but
computers are limited by their ignorance.  Programmers are hampered by:

* their language's expressiveness
* loss of information in transfer from spreadsheet to programming library

Information is lost when software discards it in order to force the data into
tabular form.  Sometimes date formatting is retained, but mostly formatting
is lost, and position has to be inferred again.

[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) addresses the programmer's problems
by not discarding information.  It imports the content, position and formatting
of cells, leaving it up to the user to associate the different forms of
information, and to re-encode them in tabular form without loss.  The
[unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) package has been developed to
assist with that step.

## Similar projects

[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) was originally derived from
[readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl) and still contains some of the same
code, hence it inherits the GPL-3 licence.
[readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl) is intended for importing tabular
data with a single row of column headers, whereas
[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) is more general, and less magic.

The [rsheets](https://github.com/rsheets) project of several R packages is in
the early stages of importing spreadsheet information from Excel and Google
Sheets into R, manipulating it, and potentially parsing and processing formulas
and writing out to spreadsheet files.  In particular,
[jailbreaker](https://github.com/rsheets/jailbreakr) attempts to extract
non-tabular data from spreadsheets into tabular structures automatically via
some clever algorithms.

[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) differs from
[rsheets](https://github.com/rsheets) in scope
([tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) will never import charts, for
example), and implementation ([tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) is
implemented mainly in C++ and is quite fast, only a little slower than
[readxl](https://github.com/hadley/readxl)).
[unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) is a package related to
[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) that provides tools for unpivoting
complex and non-tabular data layouts using I not AI (intelligence, not
artificial intelligence).  In this way it corresponds to
[jailbreaker](https://github.com/rsheets/jailbreakr), but with a different
philosophy.
